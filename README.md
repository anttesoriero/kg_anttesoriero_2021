# Kargo Sum20 Software Engineering Internship Assessment
This is my repository for the Kargo Coding Assessment for the Summer 2020 Software Engineering Internship. This problem will be done using Python. All code in this respository is done be me and me alone.

## Question
Determine whether a one-to-one character mapping exists from one string, s1, to another string, s2.

### Examples
1. Given `s1 = abc` and `s2 = bcd`, print `true` into `stdout` since we can map each character in `abc` to a character in `bcd`.

2. Given `s1 = foo` and `s2 = bar`, print `false` since the character `o` cannot map to two characters (`o = a` and `o = r`. 

3. But given `s1 = bar` and `s2 = foo`, print `true` since each character in `bar` can be mapped to a
character in `foo`.
